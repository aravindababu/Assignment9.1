a)Difference between Internal Storage, External Storage

Internal Storage- storage which is not accesses by the user except via insta apps.
                  Files saved to internal storage are private to a an application and cannot be accessed by other applications.
				  When the users uninstalls an application the app files will be removed.
				  
External Storage-The external storage is more like a public storage, so for now, it's the SD-CARD.

b) For how long the data resides in the cache?

The cache is the temporary storage area of a device or an App in case of android, which retains certain kinds of data. 
We might consider a Web page which loads faster the second time we visit the site this is because of the cache which android uses

The life of an app data inside cache depends of the life of an app,if the user uninstalls the app the cache data will be lost
or if the user want to speed up the app clearing cache will be a good option.
A cache is basically a storage area where data or frequently used processes are saved for quicker access in the future.

c) What are the critical Permissions and Normal Permissions? What are the examples of each?

Normal Permissions-These are the permissions which can be accessed from any app like camera,recorder,microphone etc

Examples-Camera: Allows full access of your camera. This group only has one permission, so itâ€™s all-or-nothing.
                   Microphone: Another group with only one permission; this allows for full access to your microphone in order to record audio.
					Storage: Apps can read your files, save files, or both. 
					A common reason for reading your storage is picking a file to share with a friend, while an app might need to write to storage so it can save a picture you edited.
					
Critical permissions - These are the permissions which no apps can access like Formatting memory.
                       An app cannot have access to the users contact lists,Emails etc
